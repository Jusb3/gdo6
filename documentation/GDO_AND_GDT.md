#GDO AND GDT

## GDT
A GDT – or gizmore data type – is something like a component or field, maybe both.
Imagine a world where you can plug the same datatypes into html tables, database entities and web forms.
A GDT always knows how to behave!

A GDT knows about rendering in different contexts, how to create db table code, and how to convert between database and application and how to validate a value.

## GDO
A GDO – or gizmore data object – is a DB Entity and DB Table at the same time – although you might not need a database to work with GDOs.
